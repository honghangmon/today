## Rule of commit messages
1. clarify the purpose of the commit in the beginning of the message as verb 
  - `create`, `edit`, `add`, `delete`
2. after that, specify why the action has been committed
  - `the date`, `the deadline of the assignments`
<br>

### As a result, commit messages would be like ...
* `create 0112.md`
* `add another assignment`
* `extend the deadline from 6pm to 12am`
<br>

## Rule of folder and file naming
1. folders should begin with # of `00`
2. space should be replaced with `_` (underbar)
3. formation of the file
   - diary: `mmdd.md`
   - template: `purpose.md`
     - live, se, me, etc...
